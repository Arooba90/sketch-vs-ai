# Sketch vs AI 


**Sketch vs AI** is a fun and interactive project where users can draw a sketch in their browser. The sketch is sent to a backend powered by an LLM with vision capabilities (via Ollama), which tries to guess what the sketch represents.

-  Uploads sketches directly to a FastAPI backend
-  Uses **Ollama** + **LLaVA model** locally for AI vision
-  Returns a fun, intelligent guess based on your drawing
-  No cloud dependencies ‚Äî everything runs locally!

## How It Works
1.You draw a sketch in your browser
2.The drawing is sent to the /upload-sketch API as a PNG
3.The backend encodes the image and sends it to a local Ollama model
4.The model returns its best guess
5.The frontend displays the result
