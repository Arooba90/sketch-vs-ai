# Sketch vs AI 


**Sketch vs AI** is a fun and interactive project where users can draw a sketch in their browser. The sketch is sent to a backend powered by an LLM with vision capabilities (via Ollama), which tries to guess what the sketch represents.

## üöÄ Features

-  In-browser canvas for freehand drawing
-  Uploads sketches directly to a FastAPI backend
-  Uses **Ollama** + **LLaVA model** locally for AI vision
-  Returns a fun, intelligent guess based on your drawing
-  No cloud dependencies ‚Äî everything runs locally!

## How It Works
1.You draw a sketch in your browser \n
2.The drawing is sent to the /upload-sketch API as a PNG \n
3.The backend encodes the image and sends it to a local Ollama model \n
4.The model returns its best guess \n
5.The frontend displays the result
